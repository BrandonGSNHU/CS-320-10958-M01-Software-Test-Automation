How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- I can ensure my code is safe and functional by running it through rigorous amounts of testing throughout the beginning and end of the development life cycle. This can also be reinforced by bringing in new sets of eyes to test and review my code before anything if officially submitted.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- A clients needs are incredibly important and although there can be some room for discussion on bending or slightly altering the clients desires for the program, following those guidelines as closely as I can is crucial. This also goes hand in hand for a users needs in any of my programs. Ensuring the final product is functioning to benefit the user is important and making that user experience flow seamlessly and easily is what I strive for. This is something I always have in the back of my head when I'm coding to make sure its incorporated.

How do I approach designing software?
- I approach designing software according to the guidelines given to me by my client. I also always try to attack my code in the most logical way possible trying to minimize the amount of code in the program and ensuring the program runs as smoothly as it can.
